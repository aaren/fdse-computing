   Internal waves behave somewhat counter-intuitively when reflecting off rigid
   walls. Because the angle formed between the wavenumber vector and the
   horizontal direction depends on the wave frequency through the dispersion
   relation, incident and reflected internal waves do not necessarily form the
   same angle with a boundary. In fact, it is possible for reflected waves to
   be parallel to a reflecting surface. This latter case is called a critical
   reflection. We can’t get critical reflections from vertical or horizontal
   walls, but it is possible to have critical reflections at sloping
   boundaries.

   Since the geometry of Diablo is rectangular, we can’t easily add a sloping
   boundary inside the domain. Instead, we can simulate internal waves
   reflecting from sloping boundaries by tilting the entire domain. 
   
   To do this, you will need to 
    -change the direction in which gravity points (change GRAV
    X, etc. in set params.m), 
    -change the density profile to have flat isopycnals
    in the rotated reference frame, and 
    -change the boundary conditions to be
    consistent with the initial conditions. 
   
   The paper by Slinn and Riley5, referenced below might be helpful in
   visualizing the setup. 
   
   Adjust the frequency of the internal wave forcing to generate critical
   reflections from the now sloping boundaries. What happens to the wave energy
   in this case?
